## Overview 
The purpose of this app is to analyze text to give feedback to use and allow user to change text based on the analysis.

The motivation behind the creation of this app was how increasingly important technology has become and how emotions can get easily lost while communicating through text. For example, have you ever sent a work email and then were surprised at people's reactions? Did your "text tone" cause problems with the interpretation of your message? This app would provide a means to analyze your text to make sure that you obtain the tone/emotion that you desire.

## Technologies Used

### Languages, Libraries, & Databases
 * HTML
 * CSS
 * Javascript
 * jQuery
 * Sentimood.js Library
 * Firebase

### APIs
* AYLIEN API for Sentiment Analysis
* Merriam-Webster Thesaurus for synonyms and antonyms

## How it Works

1. User types text to be analyzed
2. Analysis automatically appears. 
    - If there are key words from the ```Sentimood.js``` library, the words appear as buttons. 
    - Clicking on the key words displays synonyms and antonyms.
    - The synonyms and antonyms appear as buttons. Click on them will replace the original word in the text field and re-analyze the original text.

## Next Steps

With time, we would like to implement the following ideas:
* add audio analysis 
* music lyric analysis
* add foreign language
